Welcome to GameOn.World!  This is the first draft (beta 1.0) of our website which we hope will be a fun, communal way
to learn geography and other interesting trivia.  The site was started by Jeff Borland, a teacher in Portland, Maine and one of his former students
Orkhan Nadirli.  We believed that students need to know much more about the world and we thought that this game format would be a wonderful way to do that.  In the coming
months we hope to add lots of new features (like the ability to create your own trivia sets), so keep checking back.  And if you have ideas or comments we would love to hear them.
Enjoy playing.
